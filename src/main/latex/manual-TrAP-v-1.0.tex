\section{Introduction}

\textbf{TrAP} is a \textbf{Tr}ee \textbf{A}veraging \textbf{P}rogram computing medians and means of phylogenetic trees. It implements algorithms developed in~\cite{mm}. The program also allows to compute distance between two phylogenetic trees and their convex combinations using the Owen-Provan algorithm~\cite{owenprovan}.


\section{Input}
The input file has to contain (at least two) trees in the Newick format, one tree per line. The leaves of each tree are labeled by integers $0,1,\dots,n.$ The leaf $0$ can represent the root, or the outgroup of the phylogenetic tree in question.

\section{Command line usage}

\begin{itemize}
\item
\begin{verbatim}
 java iotools.TrAP d inputFile
\end{verbatim}
The letter `d' stands for `distance'. The output is the distance between the first two trees in the file `inputFile'.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
 java iotools.TrAP 1c N inputFile
\end{verbatim}
Computes the median of the trees in `inputFile' using the cyclic method with $N$ cycles.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
 java iotools.TrAP 1r N inputFile
\end{verbatim}
Computes the median of the trees in `inputFile' using the random method with $N$ iterations.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
 java iotools.TrAP 2c N inputFile
\end{verbatim}
Computes the median of the trees in `inputFile' using the cyclic method with $N$ cycles.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
 java iotools.TrAP 2r N inputFile
\end{verbatim}
Computes the median of the trees in `inputFile' using the random method with $N$ iterations.

\end{itemize}
